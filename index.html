              <p>Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong teas and black teas. Green tea originated in China, but its production and manufacture has spread to many other countries in Asia.Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest. Although there has been considerable research on the possible health effects of consuming green tea regularly, there is little evidence that drinking green tea has any effects on health. History: The tea fields in the foothills of Gorreana, Azores Islands, Portugal: the only European region other than Georgia to support green tea production. Main article: History of tea Tea consumption has its legendary origins in China during the reign of Emperor Shennong. A book written by Lu Yu in 618-907 AD (Tang dynasty), "The Classic of Tea" (simplified Chinese: 茶经; traditional Chinese: 茶經; pinyin: chájīng), is considered important in green tea history. The Kissa Yojoki (喫茶養生記 Book of Tea), written by Zen priest Eisai in 1211, describes how drinking green tea may affect five vital organs, the shapes of tea plants, flowers and leaves, and how to grow and process tea leaves. Steeping, brewing and serving Four small white bowls of tea Four varieties of green tea prior to brewing. The color of green tea brewed for 3 minutes at 90 °C (194 °F) Steeping, or brewing, is the process of making tea from leaves and hot water, generally using 2 grams (0.071 oz) of tea per 100 millilitres (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz) of water (H2O) or about 1 teaspoon of green tea per 150 ml cup. Steeping temperatures range from 61 °C (142 °F) to 87 °C (189 °F) and steeping times from 30 seconds to three minutes. Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter and longer while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually multiple times (2-3 typically). Higher-quality teas like gyokuro use more tea leaves and are steeped multiple times for short durations. Steeping too hot or too long results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew's taste is also affected by the steeping technique; two important ones are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down, and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water during consumption. <small>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea">Green Tea in China</a></small></p>

              <p>China is a large and diverse country, and its many regions have different favorite dishes. Some of these dishes include noodles, fried rice, minchee, dumplings, Mao's braised pork, and char siu. However, China’s globally recognized national dish is the Peking duck. The dish traces its origin from the Yuan dynasty in Beijing, and is characterized by its thin, crispy skin. In fact, sometimes only the skin is served and not the meat itself.Peking duck is normally served with spring onions, pancakes, sweet bean sauce, and cucumber.      History of the Dish:
              The Chinese have roasted duck since the times of the Northern and Southern dynasties. The Yuan Dynasty had various versions of roast duck, and the dish was initially known as Shaoyazi. By 1330, the dish was recognized in the manual of the imperial kitchen, but was not named ‘Peking duck’ until the Ming Dynasty. At that time, the dish was among the dishes of the imperial courts. Peking duck eventually became increasingly famous especially among China's upper classes. By the twentieth century, the dish was widely known all over China and had become a favorite dishes of tourists and diplomats. Two notable restaurants in Beijing, Quanjude and Bianyifang, have become famous for the serving Peking duck.
              Preparation:
              The conventional method of preparing Peking duck is rather complicated. First, a chef selects a white Beijing duck, and then pluck its feathers. Next, air is pumped between the duck's outer skin and flesh. The duck is then cleaned and hung on a skewer for proper drying. The chef then dusts the skin with sugar. According to tradition, the duck should be roasted in either a closed oven or hung oven using hardwood fuel that should be completely smokeless. As such, it requires careful turning until the cooking process is complete. However, despite this traditional cooking method, chefs have continue to develop new recipes over time.
              Serving Peking Duck:
              Peking duck is often served in three stages. In the first stage, the skin is dipped in sugar, as well as garlic sauce. The next step entails serving the meat with spring onions, pancakes, and sweet bean sauce. Numerous vegetables, such as cucumber sticks, can be served with the dish as well. The third stage constitutes eating the remaining fat, bones, and meat, which can be served as is, or made into a broth.
              Peking duck is a unique dish with a long and fascinating history. The dish is globally renowned, especially for its crispy and thin skin, and is found in numerous restaurants around China, especially in Beijing. <small>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-national-dish-of-china.html">National Dish in China</a></small></p>
